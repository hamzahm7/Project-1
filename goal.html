                Hopefully we can all come together to provide resources to those struggling and expand our cause
                amongst the youth and adults because everyone deserves to have a smile on their face.

                <h3>Ways for improvement!</h3>

                We should have more counselors and therapists in schools and offices because life can get stressful while 
                dealing with many stuff too it can tend to pile up. Everyone should have access to a support system around them 
                which is why myslef and many people are here for.
            </p>

            <p>
                Having more mental health discussions in school and workplaces to give people more ease so they know that 
                they can get help when needed.
